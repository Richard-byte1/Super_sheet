# Super_sheet

I made create this code while waiting for my CFA level 2 results (update : I passed :) ) 

**Supersheet** is a python based  toolkit that integrates with Excel. It allows you to perform Monte Carlo simulations of stock returns, calculate Value at Risk (VAR) for your portfolio, pull and analyze financial data, place stock and option trades, and perform Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysisâ€”all from within your Excel workflow. Please see the code and give me feedback on what to improve and what i could add.
